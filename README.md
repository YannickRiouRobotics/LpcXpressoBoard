# GPS Localized Bluetooth Field Robot

# Goal of the project 

Use the Lpcxpresso 1769 to read GPs data and send them to an Android tablet via bluetooth. 
The user will be able to view the robot position and also give checkpoint to reach with google maps.

# Progression

Reading and parsing of GPS data is quite good.
The robot is able to send them through bluetooth to the tablet.
It seems taht the LPCxpresso board is taking too much power from the battery, the GPS cannot have access to the minimum power to fix satellites.
